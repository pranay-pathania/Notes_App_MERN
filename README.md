# Notes_App_MERN
So I learnt React a few days ago and decided to make this as a MERN Stack Application

1. This is a very basic MERN project that can perform some CRUD operations.
2. Run 'npm i' in terminal for both frontend and backend folders
3. I did not use MongoDB Atlas. The connection was made by running 'mongod' in terminal. The connecting url was 'mongodb://localhost:27017/name-of-database'
4. I haven't figured out how to load the updated data every time any changes are made without creating infinite loops, so I just made a "Refresh Notes" button
5. Mistakes were made but it's an ok start
6. I still hate CSS, but tried to make it somewhat responsive; it does look a bit ugly, tho
7. Tried to implement async-await and try-catch wherever I could without breaking things 
8. I might move on to TypeScript if I access things that don't exist once more (unknowingly of course) 
9. It hasn't even been a month since I got into React, so my code is not professional
